# Photo Album App

This is a Technical Showcase Application for LEAN TECHNIQUES. It is a simple Node.js console application that, given an albumID, prints Ids and Titles of all photos within that album.

I am using Node.js to run the app and request as my HTTP request library. I use Mocha, Sinon, and Chai for unit testing.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you will need node and npm installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

Clone the Repo onto your local machine.

### Installing Dependencies

Once the project is cloned and node and npm are installed on your machine, cd into the src directory of the project using the terminal.

Install dependencies by running:

### Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed, you will run the photo-album.js file using node along with an albumId argument that must be an integer between 1-100.

Example:

```
node photo-album 27
```
